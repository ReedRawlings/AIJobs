The danger is exacerbated by open-source models who are becoming more capable at cyberattack and are more readily available by malicious actors.

However, fixing or hardening code often lags behind by months with human experts struggling to keep up with the long log of vulnerability reports. The danger is exacerbated by open-source models who are becoming more capable at cyberattack and are more readily available by malicious actors.
