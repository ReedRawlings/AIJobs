    "description": "<h2>Snapshot</h2>\n<p>Google AI Studio is the front door for millions of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to explore, prototype, and build with Google DeepMind’s most advanced generative models. As the primary interface for the Gemini API, AI Studio is central to Google’s AI developer strategy.</p>\n<p>We are looking for a Senior Product Designer to define and craft the user experience for the next generation of AI-native developer tools. This role offers a unique opportunity to design entirely new interaction patterns—from multimodal playgrounds and vibe coding environments to agentic workflows. You will help translate state-of-the-art AI capabilities into intuitive, powerful tools that accelerate how developers build the future by designing that future.</p>\n<h2>About Us</h2>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence could be one of humanity’s most useful inventions. At Google DeepMind, we’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.</p>\n<h2>The Role</h2>\n<p>The Google AI Studio team is responsible for the full-stack AI developer platform, structured around four key pillars: Discover (showcasing models), Develop (building applications/agents), Operate (platform management/console), and Learn (integrated documentation).</p>\n<p>This is a high-impact role where you will grapple with interaction design challenges that are unique to generative AI. How do developers intuitively interact with multimodal inputs (text, image, audio, video)? How do we design a first class vibe coding experience that seamlessly transitions an idea into a full application? How do we build trust and clarity in complex operational tasks like billing, quota management, and monitoring for API usage?</p>\n<p>You will own significant areas of the AI Studio roadmap, working in deeply collaborative partnerships with Product Management, Engineering, and AI Research teams. You will be responsible for establishing a cohesive, developer-centric design vision and executing it at a high level of craft. This role requires a blend of strategic thinking, exceptional interaction design skills, and a deep empathy for the developer journey in the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.</p>\n<h3>Key responsibilities:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lead the end-to-end design process for major pillars of Google AI Studio (e.g., Discover, Develop, Operate, Learn ), driving projects from initial concept through execution, launch, and iteration.</li>\n<li>Define and design novel interaction patterns for AI-native development, including multimodal prompting, agentic workflows, and AI-assisted coding environments.</li>\n<li>Collaborate closely with Product Managers and Engineering leads to define product strategy, roadmaps, and requirements, ensuring design is a key driver of product direction.</li>\n<li>Partner with UX Research to deeply understand the needs, workflows, and pain points of AI developers, translating insights into actionable design solutions.</li>\n<li>Establish and maintain a high bar for visual and interaction design quality across the AI Studio platform, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive developer experience.</li>\n<li>Work cross-functionally with teams across Google DeepMind and Google Cloud to ensure a seamless experience as developers scale their usage and manage their resources.</li>\n<li>Measure success through developer adoption, satisfaction, and the velocity at which users can successfully graduate from prototyping in AI Studio to building with the Gemini API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About You</h2>\n<p>In order to set you up for success as a Senior Product Designer at Google DeepMind, we look for the following skills and experience:</p>\n<p>Requirements (Minimum Qualifications)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5+ years of experience in Product Design, UX Design, or a related field.</li>\n<li>A portfolio demonstrating a track record of shipping complex, high-quality digital products, showcasing strong interaction design, visual design, and strategic product thinking.</li>\n<li>Experience designing developer-facing products, tools, APIs, IDEs, or complex technical platforms.</li>\n<li>Demonstrated ability to lead design strategy for ambiguous or entirely new problem spaces, translating complex technical concepts into intuitive user experiences.</li>\n<li>Proficiency with contemporary design and prototyping tools (e.g., Figma).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the following would be an advantage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demonstrated passion for the AI space, with evidence of experimentation, personal projects, or contributions within generative AI or vibe coding yourself! We love tinkerer profiles. This also includes actively staying on top of the latest trends and technologies in the AI landscape.</li>\n<li>Experience designing interfaces for Generative AI, Machine Learning tools, or prompt engineering environments.</li>\n<li>Experience designing for emerging interaction paradigms, such as agentic workflows or AI-assisted creation tools.</li>\n<li>Technical proficiency; experience with front-end prototyping or a background in software engineering, enabling deep collaboration with engineering partners on technical constraints and possibilities.</li>\n<li>Experience designing complex management consoles, dashboards, or monitoring/billing interfaces.</li>\n<li>Proven experience influencing product strategy and vision within a large organization or fast-moving startup environment, effectively advocating for user needs at all levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The US base salary range for this full-time position is between $168,000 - $266,000 + bonus + equity + benefits.
