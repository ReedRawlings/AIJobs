<p>AI’s cyberattack capability is increasing rapidly; recently, there has been a surge in the number of zero-day exploits found by AI in well-tested software. However, fixing or hardening code often lags behind by months with human experts struggling to keep up with the long log of vulnerability reports. The danger is exacerbated by open-source models who are becoming more capable at cyberattack and are more readily available by malicious actors. The goal of our project is to leverage AI for the defense: (1) automatically fix discovered vulnerabilities and (2) harden code either through checked annotations or through transformations to safer coding practices in the same language.</p>

<h4>About Us</h4>
<p>There is great interest in having AI agents execute complex and long-running tasks. For example, instead of merely creating a travel itinerary, an agent could read reviews, compare options, and finds flights, accommodations, and activities. To be able to perform all actions a human can do, it is likely our agents will need to be able perform actions via a user interface. The Gemini UI Control group is dedicated to enabling computers to understand and interact with user interfaces in a human-like manner, thereby unlocking a wide range of agentic capabilities.</p>
<p>We develop models that power UI Control applications across Google, including Project Mariner and the AI Studio Computer Use API, with more on the horizon..

<p>The VIVID team at Google DeepMind focuses on cutting-edge research to advance the capabilities of foundation models, to enable personalized, multimodal, and agentic experiences.</p>
<p>Our work spans new modeling approaches, problem definitions, and data, with a strong emphasis on the bridge between perceptual (audio, image, video) and semantic (language, code) modalities. In addition to producing highly-cited research published at top academic venues, our innovations land in flagship models like Gemini, and in Google products used by people every day.</p>
<h2>About us</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence could be one of humanity’s most useful inventions. At Google DeepMind, we’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.</p>
<h2>The role</h2>
<p>We are seeking a highly motivated and talented Research Scientist to join our team at the forefront of multimodal large language model (LLM) research. You will work alongside a world-class team of researchers and engineers to develop and advance the next generation of AI models that can seamlessly integrate and reason across different modalities such as text, images, audio, and video.</p>
<h3>Key responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Develop and implement next-generation agentic reasoning frameworks for multimodal understanding</strong>: This core responsibility involves moving beyond single-step inference to design models that can formulate complex plans, critique their own thought processes, and iteratively refine their conclusions. You will explore reinforcement learning (RL) to reward detailed reasoning chains, develop robust self-critique mechanisms for error correction, and integrate tool-use, enabling models to execute code for interactive video analysis and manipulation. Your work will directly address the project's goal of teaching models to solve problems that require deep, contextual reasoning over extended periods.</li>
<li><strong>Pioneer the extension of visual reasoning from 2D into the 3D domain, enabling a more physically-grounded form of intelligence</strong>: Your research will focus on empowering models like Gemini to not just perceive 2D images and videos, but to infer and construct coherent 3D representations of the world from them. You will then leverage this deep spatial understanding to develop novel generative capabilities, such as synthesizing photorealistic views of a scene from new perspectives or allowing for the interactive modification of 3D objects and layouts. This frontier research is crucial for unlocking future applications in robotics, mixed reality, and creating agents that can truly reason about and interact with their physical environment.</li>
<li><strong>Spearhead the creation of novel, challenging benchmarks to rigorously measure progress and define the future of visual reasoning</strong>: As models become more capable, existing benchmarks become insufficient. You will be responsible for identifying these gaps and leading the development of the next wave of evaluation datasets that test the limits of multimodal intelligence.</li>

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>AI’s cyberattack capability is increasing rapidly; recently, there has been a surge in the number of zero-day exploits found by AI in well-tested software. However, fixing or hardening code often lags behind by months with human experts struggling to keep up with the long log of vulnerability reports. The danger is exacerbated by open-source models who are becoming more capable at cyberattack and are more readily available by malicious actors. The goal of our project is to leverage AI for the defense: (1) automatically fix discovered vulnerabilities and (2) harden code either through checked annotations or through transformations to safer coding practices in the same language.</p>
<p>Our team collaborates closely with a wide variety of teams across Google/Alphabet, leveraging Google DeepMind’s expertise to deploy advanced machine learning algorithms with the goal of hardening code for Alphabet systems and beyond.</p>

<li><strong>Conduct user research</strong> and gather feedback to validate design assumptions, iterate rapidly, and deliver data-informed solutions for both technical and non-technical audiences.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype new ideas</strong> quickly, testing and validating hypotheses around AI-driven user experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Own the entire design process</strong> for projects—from concept to final implementation—maintaining a high bar for quality, usability, and visual polish.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute to our design system</strong>, ensuring consistent design language across all products, while evolving it to meet the needs of complex AI and enterprise use cases.</li>
</ul>
